## What is Praelatus?

Praelatus is a modern bug tracker and ticketing system inspired by JIRA, BugZilla, and the many support ticketing systems members of the Core Team have used throughout their careers.

Grown from frustration with today’s disparate and difficult methods of bug reporting, Praelatus aims to simplify the way other [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) projects operate. Through intuitive workflows and support for “Internet Driver’s License” accounts such as Github, Google, and Twitter, any user can submit a ticket in three clicks or less – including account creation – without the need of a user manual.

**TODO** For now Praelatus is in a *VERY* alpha state and so this documentation
will be updated and written when there is something to write about.
